# Increasing the resolution of GenCast's probabilistic weather forecasting

## Overview
Machine Learning Weather Prediction (MLWP) has emerged as a promising alternative to Numerical Weather Prediction practices commonly used by forecasting entities globally. GenCast is one such model for global weather prediction at a 12 hour, 0.25 (~30km) spatiotemporal resolution. Consisting of the combination of graph-transformer architecture and a conditional diffusion model, GenCast is able to efficiently make probabilistic predictions of future weather. While these capabilities are impressive, there is room for improvement in the resolution of the model. In its current state, GenCast cannot forecast mesoscale phenomena such as
